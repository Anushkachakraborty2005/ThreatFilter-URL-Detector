## Project Aim

The primary aim of the **ThreatFilter - Spam URL Detection** project is to provide a real-time, user-friendly web application to help users identify potentially malicious or spam URLs. By leveraging the VirusTotal API, the application scans submitted URLs against a comprehensive database of security vendors, providing immediate feedback on the URL's safety status. For safe URLs, it attempts to provide a brief, relevant description of the website content through web scraping, enhancing user confidence. The tool is designed to be an accessible first line of defense against phishing, malware, and other web-based threats.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

* **Python**: The core programming language for the application logic.
* **Streamlit**: Used for building the interactive and responsive web user interface.
* **Requests**: A robust HTTP library for making API calls to VirusTotal and fetching web page content.
* **BeautifulSoup4 (bs4)**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, used for web scraping page descriptions.
* **python-dotenv**: For securely loading environment variables (like API keys) from a `.env` file during local development.
* **VirusTotal API**: The primary service used for checking the safety and reputation of URLs.
