## Project Aim

The primary aim of the **ThreatFilter - Spam URL Detection** project is to provide a real-time, user-friendly web application to help users identify potentially malicious or spam URLs. By leveraging the VirusTotal API, the application scans submitted URLs against a comprehensive database of security vendors, providing immediate feedback on the URL's safety status. For safe URLs, it attempts to provide a brief, relevant description of the website content through web scraping, enhancing user confidence. The tool is designed to be an accessible first line of defense against phishing, malware, and other web-based threats.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

* **Python**: The core programming language for the application logic.
* **Streamlit**: Used for building the interactive and responsive web user interface.
* **Requests**: A robust HTTP library for making API calls to VirusTotal and fetching web page content.
* **BeautifulSoup4 (bs4)**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, used for web scraping page descriptions.
* **python-dotenv**: For securely loading environment variables (like API keys) from a `.env` file during local development.
* **VirusTotal API**: The primary service used for checking the safety and reputation of URLs.

This application offers the following key features:

* ‚ö° **Real-time URL Threat Analysis**: Quickly scans URLs using the VirusTotal API to determine their safety status.
* üìÑ **Automatic Website Content Description**: For safe URLs, attempts to fetch and display a brief description of the website content through web scraping.
* üìä **Simulated User Engagement Metrics**: Provides simulated user reviews and estimated user counts to give a holistic (though not real-time) view of a URL's perceived reputation.

## Model Workflow üß†

Here's a concise overview of how the ThreatFilter application processes a URL:

1.  **URL Submission & API Query**
    * User input is captured via the Streamlit frontend.
    * The URL is Base64 encoded for the VirusTotal API request.

2.  **VirusTotal Analysis & Classification**
    * An external API call is made to VirusTotal for comprehensive threat intelligence.
    * The application retrieves `last_analysis_stats` (malicious, suspicious, harmless, undetected counts) from the API response.

3.  **Application Response Interpretation**
    * Python logic parses the JSON report received from VirusTotal.
    * Streamlit's UI components are conditionally rendered based on `malicious_count` and `suspicious_count`.

4.  **Website Content Extraction (for Safe URLs)**
    * An HTTP GET request is performed on the URL using the `requests` library.
    * HTML content is parsed with BeautifulSoup4 to extract `title` and `meta description` tags.

5.  **Final Result Presentation**
    * Consolidated analysis results are displayed using various Streamlit UI components (e.g., `st.success`, `st.error`).
    * Simulated user reviews and metrics are presented for enhanced contextual feedback.
